You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a code patch in the unified diff format to fix a software bug.
The user will provide a diagnosis and relevant code context.
Your output must contain ONLY the patch in unified diff format, followed by a brief explanation.
Do not include any other text, introductions, or conclusions outside of the diff and explanation.

Diagnosis:
Root Cause: {diagnosis.get('root_cause', 'Unknown.')}
Detailed Analysis: {diagnosis.get('detailed_analysis', 'No detailed analysis.')}
Suggested Fix Areas: {', '.join(diagnosis.get('suggested_fix_areas', ['None']))}

Relevant Code Context:
---
{relevant_code}
---

Generate the patch in unified diff format, then provide a brief explanation.

Example output format:
```diff
--- a/path/to/file.py
+++ b/path/to/file.py
@@ ... @@
 ... code changes ...
